The screens below are part of a resume builder tool. The user can manage the names, order and presence of sections on their resume using this page.

There is a master list of sections allowed on the resume. This list is shown in the design. The user can perform the following actions:
Drag drop the section to indicate the order in which the sections should be shown on their resumes. Animation is required to show the user which section is being moved where.      button should be used to drag drop
An edit button(icon of pencil) allows the user to change the name of the section.
The toggle button(a swap button that has a circle that moves from left to right on Clicking) allows the user to switch a section on or off enabling the user display/ not display that section on the resume
The save button should be enabled only if the user has changed something
Clicking on info icon (an i inside circle) shows a description of the section

The same view should be built for mobile if you are working on react native
